            <h1>New York City subway bomber should get life sentence, prosecutors say</h1>
            <p><strong>Published</strong> 09.04.2021</p>
            <p>A Bangladeshi immigrant who set off a pipe bomb attached to his chest in New York City’s busiest subway station should spend the rest of his life behind bars for a "premeditated and vicious" terror attack committed on behalf of the Islamic State group.
            </p>
            <p>In papers filed in federal court in Manhattan, the government argued that Akayed Ullah has never taken proper responsibility for the December 2017 attempted suicide bombing in a pedestrian tunnel beneath Times Square and the Port Authority bus terminal.</p>
            <p>
                After growing angry at American foreign policy in the Middle East, Ullah grew consumed by online Islamic State propaganda "glorifying brutally violent stabbings, shootings, and bombings targeting Americans," prosecutors told a judge in a sentencing memo. "He ultimately answered ISIS’s call for its supporters to carry out ‘lone-wolf’ terrorist attacks in the United States. Ullah’s attack was premeditated and vicious."
